`dx` is currently in very early development. There are no working features and I don't even know if everything I wan't to do
is possible.


# Vision

This project aims to solve 2 issues. 
1. I don't want to read detailed read-me's
whenever I need to work on a new project.
2. I hate spending hours trying to get the right binary version for my program to
compile.
Ideally, you would open a project. Run `dx up` and everything would be
configured as specified in the project's `dx.yaml` file. Including all the
dependencies, and environment variables.

# Usage

There are no exported binaries right now. You can run `go run src/main.go up`
with a `dx.yaml` file in the current directory.
